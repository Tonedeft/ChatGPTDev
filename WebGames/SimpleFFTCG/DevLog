Starting with a basic html file with js scripting to display cards on the table and manipulate them in some way.

Today, trying to set up a microservices architecture where I can have users log index

Installing node.js
https://nodejs.org/en

Setting up express framework to access my html files

Copied source code for the book from: https://pragprog.com/titles/egmicro/practical-microservices/
I couldn't find full source code anywhere in the book.

Ran 
> npm install

There were 9 vulnerabilities, 5 high
it recommended running npm audit fix --force

So I ran
> npm audit fix --force

"found 0 vulnerabilities"

Probably just the older versions from an older book


I need a PostgreSQL database running
Following book instructions to create docker-compose.yaml

To run database:
> docker-compose rm -sf
> docker-compose up

To run server connecting to that database:
> npm run start-dev-server
